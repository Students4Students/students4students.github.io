	<h3>How does the application process work?</h3>
	
	<p>All applicants will submit an application form; successful applicants will then be offered an interview, which will consist of a short talk about why you want to be a tutor before you will be given a set of scenarios and be asked to respond. If you are successful in your interview you will then need to complete a DBS check, once this is done you are a volunteer</p>

	<h3>Are volunteers given training?</h3>
	
	<p>As a volunteer you will have to take part in two sets of mandatory training before you start. The first is child welfare training and the second is our 'tutoring guide'. The 'tutoring guide' will give you the skills to begin tutoring. Once you begin tutoring there will be other training opportunities to ensure that you keep improving as a tutor</p>

	<h3>What support do you provide tutors?</h3>
	
	<p>All our tutors receive support throughout their time working for Students4Students. This ranges from the socials we provide to ensure you get to know the other tutors near you, to the more formal <a href="/about-the-committee.html">tutor liaison officer</a> who is there to answer any questions you have and ensure we are giving you everything you need to be a fantastic tutor</p>
	
	</li>
