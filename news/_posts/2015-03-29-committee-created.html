<p>The first step Will and I took to ensure the success of our project was to recruit other like minded people to help us in our journey. We were so pleased with the caliber of all of the people who expressed an interest in our project. Once we had received the applications it was time to interview the candidates and it was fair to say they were all a fantastic group.</p>

<p>In the interviews we asked them a selection of questions, including obviously their relevant experience and what they thought they could bring to the team. However more important for us was why they wanted to help us. It is our firm belief that enthusiasm is what differentiates an outstanding volunteer from just a good volunteer.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we know have a fantastic committee who have already achieved so much. All that is left now is to introduce them.</p>
