On the 20th of April, Alex Astley, an ex-Verulam Student who now attends Oxford University, won the Adrian Evans award which was presented to him by The Princess Royal. The award, which is sponsored by Lattitude Global Volunteering, recognises dedication to continued volunteering and was given to Alex for his recent work in co-founding the educational charity Students4Students. The award also included a &pound;400 prize fund which goes towards the charity. In addition to the Adrian Evans award Students4Students was also a finalist in the O2 ThinkBig challenge where they were awarded &pound;300.

Alex co-founded Students4Students with Will Clare after they returned from a three month volunteer placement in Ghana in the summer of 2014. The charity empowers young people, those aged between 16-25, to become volunteer tutors for primary school children who are at risk of not fulfilling their potential. The tutors work with the pupils on a one-to-one basis in either maths or English for an hourly session once a week. The charity currently works with two schools in the Oxford area but is already looking to expand, including into the St.Albans district.

When asked for his reaction on winning the award Alex said 'It was fantastic to meet The Princess Royal and have all the work that  Will, myself and all of the volunteers have put in recognised. The prize fund will certainly help us to achieve our aims and hopefully allow us to expand and help more children.' However it was not just Alex who was enthused about the whole event. The Princess Royal also had some very insightful words to say, including this quote that truly epitomises the focus of Students4Students:
