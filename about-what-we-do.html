	<h1>The basics:</h1>

<p>As a charity, we are focused primarily on English and Maths as a foundation for our tutoring. 

Our main aim is to educate primary school children - who aren’t quite reaching their potential 

in class - with one-to-one hourly tutoring sessions taken by university and sixth form 

students each week. Through this, we will be able to equip students heading in years 5 and 

6 with the confidence and capability they need in order to reach their potential and excel 

beyond it. We believe that every students has the right and capacity to learn to their best 

ability and at times a large classroom can be overwhelming. On a one-to-one basis 

Students4Students is empowering tutors to drive the change in primary education, giving 

primary school students a foundation on which they can continue to grow; helping the many 

great primary school teachers in the UK. </p>

<h1>Strategy and Rationale:</h1>

<p>Our strategy works in two ways: educating young children, and empowering young adults. 

Volunteering with Students4Students will give undergraduates and sixth formers direction, 

confidence and a platform to learn vital skills through training opportunities to get them ready 

for graduation and beyond. Students4Students equips young pupils at primary schools the 

methods to understand and build upon their knowledge reaching higher and higher. With a 

closer one-to-one learning structure hourly each week, the possibilities are endless. The 

future of Students4Students is the future of educational equality, educating tomorrow with 

today’s brightest.</p>
