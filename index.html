		<h1>A Word from the Founders</h1>
		
		<p>We believe that all children should be given an equal opportunity to achieve and learn in life. However unfortunately there isn't equal opportunity and many children are unable to achieve their full potential. We see Students4Students as part of the solution to this problem. The one-to-one tutoring that we provide ensures the child gets tailored help, which not only helps them towards fulfilling their potential but also helps with their confidence too. 
		<br>	
		Students4Students is there to make a difference to these children's lives. We hope that you will support us as we grow the charity and work with more children.</p>
