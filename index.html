			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Students4Students is an educational charity, co-founded by Will and Alex in early 2015, which works with primary schools to help pupils not fulfilling their potential. We currently operate in the Oxfordshire area with two schools but are already looking at expanding to other areas so that we can help more children.</p>

		<h1>A Word from the Founders</h1>
		<p>We believe that all children should be given an equal opportunity to achieve and learn in life. However unfortunately there isn't equal opportunity and many children are unable to achieve their full potential. We see Students4Students as part of the solution to this problem. The one-to-one tutoring that we provide ensures the child gets tailored help, which not only helps them towards fulfilling their potential but also helps with their confidence too. 
		<br>	
		Students4Students is there to make a difference to these children's lives. We hope that you will support us as we grow the charity and work with more children.</p>
